# PlayStation Button Prompts for Melatonin

## Description

When Steam Input is enabled regular ABXY prompts are shown instead of the expected PlayStation prompts. Melatonin currently only shows PlayStation button prompts when you have Steam Input disabled. Unfortunately, disabling Steam Input currently makes the game freak out. This mod replaces the standard gamepad prompts with the built-in PlayStation prompts to fix this problem.

## Installation

1. Install the x86 version of [BepInEx 6](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/unity_mono.html)
2. Drag and drop `PlaystationPrompts.dll` to the BepInEx plugins directory
